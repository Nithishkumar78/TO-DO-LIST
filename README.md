To-Do List Web Application (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

Hi everyone! I’m excited to share one of my recent solo development projects — a sleek and interactive To-Do List Web Application, built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript with dynamic theme-switching and animation effects.

Tech Stack Used:

1. HTML5 for semantic layout and structure
2. CSS3 for styling, gradients, transitions and responsive design
3. JavaScript for logic, DOM manipulation and event handling
4. FontAwesome for intuitive icons
5. Google Fonts for a clean UI experience

Objective:

The goal of this project was to create a minimal yet visually engaging app that helps users manage tasks efficiently.
Key features include:

* Adding, completing, and deleting tasks
* Smooth theme toggling (Standard, Light, Darker)
* Typing text animation for enhanced interactivity
* Data persistence through localStorage
* Fully responsive layout for both desktop and mobile

Scope:

What started as a UI/UX practice app has strong potential to scale into a more complete productivity solution — with features like deadline reminders, filters, and user authentication in future iterations.
It also serves as a great base for React-based task managers or full-stack versions.

Personal Takeaway:

This project gave me a great opportunity to polish my front-end development skills and deepened my understanding of:

* DOM traversal and manipulation
* CSS animations and responsive layouts
* Efficient local state handling without frameworks

Designing a user-friendly interface and implementing clean transitions taught me how powerful even a simple app can be when combined with thoughtful interaction design.
